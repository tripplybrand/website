            "The places we have known do not belong solely to the world of space
            in which we situate them for our greater convenience. They were only
            a thin slice among contiguous impressions which formed our life at
            that time; the memory of a certain image is but regret for a certain
            moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fleeting, alas, as the
            years."
